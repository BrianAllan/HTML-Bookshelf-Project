    			<p>Ian H. Witten is a professor of computer science at the University of Waikato in New Zealand. 
      		He directs the New Zealand Digital Library research project. His research interests include 
      		information retrieval, machine learning, text compression, and programming by demonstration. 
      		He received an MA in Mathematics from Cambridge University, England; an MSc in Computer Science 
      		from the University of Calgary, Canada; and a PhD in Electrical Engineering from Essex University, 
      		England. He is a fellow of the ACM and of the Royal Society of New Zealand. He has published widely 
      		on digital libraries, machine learning, text compression, hypertext, speech synthesis and signal processing, and computer typography.</p>
    			<p>Eibe Frank lives in New Zealand with his Samoan spouse and two lovely boys, 
    			but originally hails from Germany, where he received his first degree in computer science 
    			from the University of Karlsruhe. He moved to New Zealand to pursue his Ph.D. in machine 
    			learning under the supervision of Ian H. Witten and joined the Department of Computer Science 
    			at the University of Waikato as a lecturer on completion of his studies. He is now an associate 
    			professor at the same institution. As an early adopter of the Java programming language, he 
    			laid the groundwork for the Weka software described in this book. He has contributed a number of 
    			publications on machine learning and data mining to the literature and has refereed for many conferences and journals in these areas.</p>
    			<p>Mark A. Hall holds a bachelorâ€™s degree in computing and mathematical sciences and a Ph.D. in 
    			computer science, both from the University of Waikato. Throughout his time at Waikato, as a student 
    			and lecturer in computer science and more recently as a software developer and data mining consultant 
    			for Pentaho, an open-source business intelligence software company, Mark has been a core contributor 
    			to the Weka software described in this book. He has published several articles on machine learning and 
    			data mining and has refereed for conferences and journals in these areas.</p>
