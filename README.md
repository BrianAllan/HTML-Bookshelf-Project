## HTML Data Science Bookshelf Project

### Project Description

The aim of this project is to exercise my newly acquired abilities at coding in HTML and CSS.  Of course, there are various website builders that would make this task easier without delving much into the code.  But, here I aim to build from scratch.  (Well, perhaps with a few minimalist helping tools, like a layout grid such as the 960 Grid System.)  The desired output is a visual display of the various books that I own that pertain to data science.
